### NOTES FOR IDENTIFYING AGM_E9.5 CELL CLUSTERS ###

## 5 clusters:

1) Megakaryocytes?
Genes expressed:
"Kitl"(very present)
"Kdr"(increasing)

2) 
Genes expressed:
"Kitl"(somewhat present)
"Sox17"(increases expression)
"Kdr"(very present)
"Cdh5"(increasing)

3) AECs
Genes expressed:
"Runx1"(begins increasing) 
"Kitl"(decreases, no longer present in cluster 4)
"Notch1"(increases expression)
"Gfi1"(begins expression)
"Sox17"(expression increases)
"Cd93"(expresses fully)
"Kdr"(decreases)
"Gata2"(very present)
"Gja4" and "Gja5"(present - unique to AECs!)
"Cdh5"(very expressed)
Notes: 
- "Runx1" expression marks transition from endothelial cell to hematopoietic 
	cell.

4) HECs
Genes expressed: 
"Runx1"(fully present) 
"Notch1"(fully present)
"Gata2"(expression increases)
"Gfi1"(fully expressed)
"Sox17"(decreases expression)
"Kit"(becomes fully expressed)
Notes:
- This could represent successful transition from endo-cells to hema-cells

5) 
Genes expressed: 
"Kitl"(somewhat present)
Notes:

All) 
Genes expressed: 
"Tek", "Notch1", "Gata2", "Sox17", "Cd93"
Notes:
- Notch1, Gata2, Sox17 are in part responsible for transition from endothelial cells to hematopoietic cells

Candidate Cells:
- Macrophages
- Stomal Cells
- Megakaryocytes (create platelets)
- Perivascular cells
- Osteolineage cells
- T-Cells
- B-Cells
